# microsoft_family_end.bat
Bypasses Microsoft Family features on your Windows PC - time limits, activity monitor etc...

If possible, run microsoft_family_end.bat as administrator to avoid permission based errors.

You will obviously have to run this code before your laptop gets locked other wise you are locked out until you get access back from a parent or guardian. 

Note: every time you reboot your computer, WPCMON.EXE will load up (the family features monitor program) meaning you will get locked out again if you have been scheduled to be locked out at that time, hence setting the batch file as a startup program or creating another user on your laptop may be ideal to be able to run the command on there and then switch back to your main account and regain access.
